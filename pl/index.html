            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>üìú Pay ¬£10 to join Last Man Balling. You will be asked to provide a name (ideally your Twitter username) and an email address during the checkout process. You will be provided with a secret Personal Identification Number (PIN) with your payment confirmation.</p>
            <p>üèÜ The entry fees will contribute to the overall prize (or ‚ÄòPrizepot‚Äô) for winning the game. For the first game, 90% of entry fees will go into the prizepot and the remainder will go towards running costs such as hosting, promotional and administration fees. The more Ballers, the bigger the Prizepot.</p>
            <p>üéØ Every week you must select a team that you think will win. To submit your prediction, you must complete an online form where you will enter your name, your PIN and the team you have chosen. All predictions must be submitted before the Gameweek deadline, which is 6PM every Friday.</p>
            <p>‚ùå You can only choose each team once. For example, if you choose Manchester City in a previous Gameweek, you cannot choose them again. If your chosen team wins their match, you progress to the next Gameweek. If your chosen team loses or draws, you are eliminated.</p>
