            <h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>üí∑ Pay ¬£10 to join Last Man Balling. You will be asked to provide a name (as it will be displayed on the public leaderboard) and a phone number during the checkout process. You will then be added to the Last Man Balling <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a>.</li>
    <li>üçØ The entry fees contribute to the overall prize (or ‚ÄòPrizepot‚Äô) for winning the game. For the first game, 90% of entry fees will go into the Prizepot, with the remainder covering running costs such as hosting, promotional, and administration fees. The more Ballers, the bigger the Prizepot.</li>
    <li>üéØ Every week, you must select a team that you think will win. All team selections are provided on WhatsApp. All predictions must be submitted before the kickoff of the first match in the current Gameweek. Gameweeks are the same as those used in Fantasy Premier League.</li>
    <li>üö´ You can only choose each team once. For example, if you chose Manchester City in a previous Gameweek, you cannot choose them again. If you submit a prediction for a team you have already chosen, it will be treated as a failed submission.</li>
    <li>üÜé If you fail to submit a selection before the deadline, you will be assigned the first team that you haven‚Äôt already selected, alphabetically. For example, if you have already chosen Arsenal but haven‚Äôt used Aston Villa, you will be assigned Aston Villa.</li>
    <li>‚úÖ If your predicted team wins, you survive and carry on Balling until the next week.</li>
    <li>‚ùå If your predicted team draws or loses, you will lose a life.</li>
    <li>3Ô∏è‚É£ Ballers start with three lives. Once your lives reach 0, your Balling days are over, and you are eliminated from the game.</li>
    <li>üèÜ The last remaining Baller, aka the Last Man Balling, wins the Prizepot. Winners will be contacted via WhatsApp to confirm payment details and will be paid within ten working days.</li>
    <li>üíÄ If everyone is eliminated without a single Baller being left standing, there will be a Ballover. For example, if three Ballers remain going into a Gameweek and they all end up losing their final life in the same set of fixtures, everyone is eliminated and a Ballover will occur.</li>
    <li>üßª In the event of a Ballover, Ballers wishing to re-join must pay a ¬£10 entry fee again. All previous team predictions are reset, and the Prizepot will continue to build.</li>
    <li>‚ùì If you have any questions, please ask in the <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a> or contact <a href="https://x.com/LastManBalling" target="_blank" rel="external">@LastManBalling</a> on ùïè.</li>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Last Man Balling?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">Last Man Balling is a weekly Premier League competition where you choose a team to win each week. If your team wins, you carry on Balling; if they lose or draw, you lose a life. Players have three lives in total.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">The entry fee is ¬£10.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I pay?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">All payments are taken via Stripe. <a href="https://buy.stripe.com/fZe9E58bagsp16E3cc" target="_blank" rel="external">Click here to pay</a>. Stripe accepts all major credit and debit cards, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>When is the deadline to submit my selection?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">The deadline to submit your selection is the kickoff of the first match in the current Gameweek. Gameweeks are the same as those used in Fantasy Premier League.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How do I submit my selection?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">You must submit your weekly selection via the <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I see which teams I have selected so far?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">Yes, all selections so far can be viewed on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ydg8u01uMIOV8a2HiIL9dDnf6MarOM_-/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114070134683489176550&rtpof=true&sd=true" target="_blank" rel="external">this Google Sheet</a>.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if my team draws?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">You only keep your lives intact if your team wins. A draw is the same as a defeat. If your team draws, you will lose a life, just like you would if your team lost.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I earn or buy more lives?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">No, it is not possible to recover lost lives or earn more than the three you start with.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I do not submit a selection before the deadline?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">If you fail to submit a selection before the deadline, you will be assigned the first team that you haven‚Äôt already selected, alphabetically.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if the team I select has their game postponed?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">If you select a team from a game that is postponed, you will progress to the next Gameweek without losing a life.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What happens if everyone is eliminated and nobody wins?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">If everyone is eliminated without a single Baller remaining, there will be a Ballover. The game will restart, and everyone wishing to play again must pay the ¬£10 entry fee, which will be added to the existing Prizepot. All team selections are reset, and the game starts again completely. New Ballers will be also allowed to join.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>If I pick a later kickoff, will I be eliminated later than other Ballers?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">No, kickoff times are not taken into account. Whoever loses a life in a Gameweek, loses it all at the same time. You cannot prevent a Ballover by choosing a later kickoff.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I play if I am outside of the UK?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">Yes, anyone over the age of 18 from anywhere in the world can join.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I play if I am under 18?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">No. Due to the nature of the Last Man Balling rules, gambling activities regulated under the Gambling Act 2005 are restricted to over 18s. Anyone found to be taking part who is under 18 will be removed from the game and will not be refunded.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I play if I don‚Äôt have social media?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">Of course. However, all players must join the official Last Man Balling <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a> to submit their selections. You may also wish to follow <a href="https://x.com/LastManBalling" target="_blank" rel="external">@LastManBalling</a> on ùïè</a> to keep up to date with the latest fixtures, selections, eliminations, and more.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I missed the chance to sign up before Round 1. Can I still play?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, you cannot join once a game has started. However, in the event of a Ballover where no singular winner is declared, you will be able to join. Please sign up to the <a href="https://forms.gle/ePspMwccbbtrvwjV9" target="_blank" rel="external">Waiting List</a> to be notified in the event of a Ballover. As soon as a game starts, it will not be possible to pay the ¬£10 entry fee to join the game.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I join multiple times?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">No. All Ballers can only join once, and anyone found to be submitting multiple selections will be eliminated from the game and will not receive a refund.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I pay in advance for any potential Ballovers?</h3>
        <div class="faq-content" style="text-align: justify;">No, you can only pay ¬£10 for the current game.</div>
