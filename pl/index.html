            <h2>Rules</h2>
<ul>
    <li>üí∑ Pay ¬£10 to join Last Man Balling. You will be asked to provide a name (as it will be displayed on the public leaderboard) and a phone number during the checkout process. You will then be added to the Last Man Balling <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a>.</li>
    <li>üçØ The entry fees contribute to the overall prize (or ‚ÄòPrizepot‚Äô) for winning the game. For the first game, 90% of entry fees will go into the Prizepot, with the remainder covering running costs such as hosting, promotional, and administration fees. The more Ballers, the bigger the Prizepot.</li>
    <li>üéØ Every week, you must select a team that you think will win. All team selections are provided on WhatsApp. All predictions must be submitted before the kickoff of the first match in the current Gameweek. Gameweeks are the same as those used in Fantasy Premier League.</li>
    <li>üö´ You can only choose each team once. For example, if you chose Manchester City in a previous Gameweek, you cannot choose them again. If you submit a prediction for a team you have already chosen, it will be treated as a failed submission.</li>
    <li>üÜé If you fail to submit a selection before the deadline, you will be assigned the first team that you haven‚Äôt already selected, alphabetically. For example, if you have already chosen Arsenal but haven‚Äôt used Aston Villa, you will be assigned Aston Villa.</li>
    <li>‚úÖ If your predicted team wins, you survive and carry on Balling until the next week.</li>
    <li>‚ùå If your predicted team draws or loses, you will lose a life.</li>
    <li>3Ô∏è‚É£ Ballers start with three lives. Once your lives reach 0, your Balling days are over, and you are eliminated from the game.</li>
    <li>üèÜ The last remaining Baller, aka the Last Man Balling, wins the Prizepot. Winners will be contacted via WhatsApp to confirm payment details and will be paid within ten working days.</li>
    <li>üíÄ If everyone is eliminated without a single Baller being left standing, there will be a Ballover. For example, if three Ballers remain going into a Gameweek and they all end up losing their final life in the same set of fixtures, everyone is eliminated and a Ballover will occur.</li>
    <li>üßª In the event of a Ballover, Ballers wishing to re-join must pay a ¬£10 entry fee again. All previous team predictions are reset, and the Prizepot will continue to build.</li>
    <li>‚ùì If you have any questions, please ask in the <a href="https://akr.st/lmbwa" target="_blank" rel="external">WhatsApp group</a> or contact <a href="https://x.com/LastManBalling" target="_blank" rel="external">@LastManBalling</a> on ùïè.</li>
